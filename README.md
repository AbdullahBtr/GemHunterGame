# GemHunterGame
2d Java game from scratch without any external libraries. Can be used as the starting point if you want to dive in game programming or extend your Java knowledge. Maybe in near future I will do a code refactoring by adding javadoc to the classes and methods and also finish the last part e.g. adding equipment feature, being able to use weapons on the main character.
